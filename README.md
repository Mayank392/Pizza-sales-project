# Pizza-sales-project

This project focuses on analyzing pizza sales data using Power BI for interactive data visualization and SQL for data extraction and problemsolving. 
The primary goal is to gain actionable insights into the business performance through detailed analysis of sales metrics. Together, Power BI and SQL enable a comprehensive sales analysis to support better decision-making and uncover growth opportunities in the pizza business

This project is centered around the analysis of pizza sales using SQL for data exploration and Power BI for visualization.
It aims to uncover insights into sales performance and customer preferences by combining data-driven queries with dynamic dashboards.

Key objectives include:
Retrieving the total number of orders placed.
Calculating the total revenue generated from pizza sales.
Identifying the highest-priced pizza on the menu.
Determining the most commonly ordered pizza size.
Listing the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities.
 
Using SQL, we answered these business questions with precise queries, while Power BI brought those insights to life through clear visualizationsâ€”such as total revenue, pizza size distribution, top-selling pizzas, and category-based performance. This integrated approach offers a holistic view of the business and helps in making informed decisions.
